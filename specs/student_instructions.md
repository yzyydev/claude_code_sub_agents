## Legal Analysis Methodology

### The IRAC Framework
Each scenario should be analyzed using the **IRAC method**:

#### **I - Issue Identification**
**Primary Questions:**
- What legal questions are presented by these facts?
- Which areas of law are implicated?
- Are there threshold issues (jurisdiction, standing, statute of limitations)?

**Practical Steps:**
1. Read the scenario completely before identifying issues
2. List all potential legal claims and defenses
3. Prioritize issues by importance and likelihood of success
4. Consider procedural as well as substantive issues

#### **R - Rule Statement**
**Research Requirements:**
- Identify applicable statutes, regulations, and case law
- Understand the elements of each legal claim or defense
- Note any exceptions, limitations, or special circumstances
- Consider jurisdictional variations in legal standards

**Documentation Standards:**
- Cite authoritative sources (statutes, regulations, leading cases)
- Use proper legal citation format
- Distinguish between mandatory and persuasive authority
- Note any recent developments or trends in the law

#### **A - Application & Analysis**
**Factual Analysis:**
- Identify legally significant facts
- Note factual disputes and ambiguities
- Consider what additional facts might be helpful
- Analyze facts in light of legal standards

**Legal Reasoning:**
- Apply legal rules to specific facts
- Address counterarguments and alternative interpretations
- Consider policy implications and practical consequences
- Evaluate strength of each party's position

#### **C - Conclusion**
**Comprehensive Assessment:**
- Predict likely outcomes for each legal issue
- Consider practical implications and remedies
- Address client counseling and strategic considerations
- Identify opportunities for settlement or alternative resolution

### Advanced Analysis Techniques

#### **Multi-Issue Integration**
For complex scenarios with multiple legal issues:
1. **Issue Interaction Analysis:** How do different legal claims relate to each other?
2. **Procedural Sequencing:** What order should issues be resolved in?
3. **Strategic Prioritization:** Which issues are most important for each party?

#### **Multi-Party Analysis**
For scenarios involving multiple parties:
1. **Relationship Mapping:** Understand connections between all parties
2. **Claim Analysis:** Identify all potential claims between parties
3. **Defense Coordination:** Consider how defenses might interact
4. **Settlement Dynamics:** Analyze how multi-party structure affects resolution

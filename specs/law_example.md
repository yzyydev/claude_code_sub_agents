## Implementation Notes

### Development Process
1. Subject matter expert creates initial scenario draft

4. Student testing with feedback collection
5. Revision and finalization

### Maintenance Requirements
- Annual review of all scenarios for legal updates
- Feedback collection from educators and students
- Regular updates to reflect changes in law and society
- Version control for tracking modifications

### Assessment Integration
- Scenarios can be used for class discussions, written assignments, or examinations
- Rubrics should be developed for consistent grading

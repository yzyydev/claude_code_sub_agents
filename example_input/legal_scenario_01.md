# Legal Scenario 01: The Startup Software Developer Employment Dispute

## Case Title
Martinez v. TechFlow Solutions LLC - Employment Contract Formation and Breach

## Area of Law
Contract Law - Employment Contracts

## Difficulty Level
Beginner

## Fact Pattern

In January 2024, Sofia Martinez, a recent computer science graduate, interviewed with TechFlow Solutions LLC, a small software development startup in Austin, Texas. During the interview, CEO David Chen verbally offered Martinez a position as a Junior Software Developer with the following terms:

- Starting salary: $75,000 per year
- Two weeks paid vacation
- Standard health benefits after 90 days
- Flexible work-from-home arrangement (3 days in office, 2 days remote)
- Stock options to be "worked out later"

Martinez accepted the verbal offer immediately and Chen said, "Great! We'll get the paperwork sorted out soon. Can you start Monday?" Martinez agreed and quit her part-time retail job the next day.

Martinez began work on January 15, 2024, and performed her duties satisfactorily. However, no written employment contract was ever provided. When Martinez asked about it after two weeks, Chen said they were "still working with their lawyer" and assured her everything was fine.

On March 1, 2024, TechFlow's HR manager, Janet Wilson, presented Martinez with a written employment contract that differed significantly from the verbal agreement:

- Salary: $65,000 per year (not $75,000)
- One week paid vacation (not two weeks)
- No remote work provision (full-time office requirement)
- No mention of stock options
- 6-month probationary period with at-will termination

When Martinez objected, Wilson claimed these were always the intended terms and that Martinez must have "misunderstood" the original offer. Martinez refused to sign the contract. Two days later, Chen terminated Martinez's employment, stating that her refusal to sign showed she "wasn't committed to the company."

Martinez worked for 6.5 weeks total and was paid $9,615 at the $75,000 annual rate for her work performed. She now seeks the difference between what she was promised and what was offered in writing, plus damages for wrongful termination.

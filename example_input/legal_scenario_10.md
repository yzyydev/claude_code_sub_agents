## Difficulty Level

## Fact Pattern

Jessica Johnson, a 28-year-old graduate student, signed a one-year residential lease for a studio apartment at 1247 Pine Street in Columbus, Ohio on August 15, 2023. The lease term runs from September 1, 2023, to August 31, 2024, with monthly rent of $950 plus utilities. Johnson paid $950 as the first month's rent and $950 as a security deposit before moving in.

The landlord, Pine Street Properties LLC, is managed by property manager Robert Chen. The lease agreement contains standard provisions including:
- Tenant responsible for utilities (gas, electric, water/sewer)
- No pets allowed
- Landlord responsible for major repairs and maintenance
- 24-hour notice required for landlord entry except in emergencies
- Security deposit to be returned within 30 days of lease termination, minus deductions for damages beyond normal wear and tear

Johnson moved into the apartment on September 1, 2023. The apartment appeared to be in good condition, though she noticed the heating unit was old. She did not conduct a formal move-in inspection with the landlord, and no move-in checklist was provided.

**The Heating Problem:**
On October 15, 2023, as temperatures began dropping, Johnson discovered that the heating unit was not working properly. The apartment temperature would not rise above 58°F even when the thermostat was set to 72°F. Johnson immediately contacted Pine Street Properties and spoke with Chen, reporting the heating issue.

Chen promised to "look into it" but took no immediate action. After three days with no response, Johnson called again. Chen told her he would send a repair person "sometime next week." When no repair person arrived by October 25, Johnson sent a written email to Chen detailing the problem and requesting immediate repair.

Chen replied by email on October 27, stating that the heating system was "working fine" when the apartment was last inspected and suggesting Johnson might be "too picky about temperature." He advised her to wear warmer clothes and use space heaters.

**Johnson's Response:**
Frustrated by the lack of response, Johnson purchased two space heaters for $280 and continued living in the apartment. Her electricity bill increased from approximately $45 per month to $180 per month due to the space heaters. She documented the temperature in her apartment daily, showing it never exceeded 62°F during the heating season.

On November 15, 2023, Johnson sent Chen a certified letter stating that the heating problem constituted a violation of the warranty of habitability and demanding repairs within 30 days. She also stated that if repairs were not completed, she would consider the lease breached and move out.

Chen received the letter but did not respond. No repair person ever came to examine the heating unit.

**Johnson Moves Out:**
On December 20, 2023, Johnson gave Chen written notice that she was terminating the lease due to the landlord's failure to provide adequate heating. She moved out on January 15, 2024, and returned the keys to Chen.

On February 20, 2024, Johnson received a letter from Pine Street Properties stating that her security deposit would not be returned. The letter listed the following deductions:
- Carpet cleaning: $200
- Wall touch-up paint: $150
- Cleaning fee: $100
- Early lease termination penalty: $500
- Total deductions: $950 (entire security deposit)

Johnson disputes all these charges. She maintained the apartment in clean condition and argues that any cleaning or painting needed would constitute normal wear and tear. She also contends that she was entitled to terminate the lease due to the landlord's breach of the warranty of habitability.

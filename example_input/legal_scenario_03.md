## Difficulty Level

## Fact Pattern

The 85-acre Riverside Mill Complex sits along the Clearwater River in a rapidly gentrifying area of Millbrook County. The property has a complex ownership and usage history dating back to 1847, when the original gristmill was established by German immigrant Friedrich Mueller. Over the decades, portions of the land were sold, subdivided, and burdened with various easements, creating a web of overlapping property rights that has now erupted into litigation.

**Historical Background (1847-1980):**
The original mill property included water rights, a mill race channel, and associated farmland. In 1923, the Mueller family granted a perpetual easement to the newly formed Millbrook Electric Cooperative for power lines crossing the northern portion of the property. In 1956, the county established a 20-foot public right-of-way for the construction of River Access Road, which runs along the eastern boundary. The 1967 deed from Heinrich Mueller to his three children contained ambiguous language regarding the division of water rights and included a handwritten addendum in German that was never officially translated.

**Recent Developments (1980-Present):**
In 1987, the Miller Family Trust purchased 45 acres of the original property, including the historic mill building, through a foreclosure sale. The deed description referenced "all appurtenant water rights and easements of record," but the title company's examination missed several unrecorded easements from the 1940s-1960s era. In 2019, Riverside Development Corp. purchased the remaining 40 acres with plans to build a luxury residential community called "Heritage Commons."

**Current Conflict:**
Riverside Development's survey revealed that the property boundaries have been in dispute for decades. The Miller Family Trust has been operating a successful artisan mill and event venue, claiming exclusive water rights and arguing that their long-term use has created prescriptive easements. Meanwhile, three neighboring property owners claim various rights:

1. **Margaret Chen** owns a 2-acre parcel that may have been part of the original mill property. Her deed from 1978 includes language granting her "reasonable access to the river for domestic and agricultural purposes." She has been drawing water for her organic farm through a pipe system installed in 1985.

2. **Millbrook Hiking Club** claims a prescriptive easement for a walking trail that has crossed the property for over 30 years. They argue the trail provides crucial public access to the river and connects to the county park system.

3. **Thomas Kowalski** purchased a narrow strip of land in 2015 that contains part of the historic mill race. His property is completely landlocked except for what he claims is a deeded right-of-way across the Miller Trust property. However, the Miller Trust argues this easement was abandoned when the mill race stopped operating in 1962.

**Current Disputes:**
The situation became critical in March 2023 when Riverside Development began preliminary construction work. Their activities included:
- Installing temporary fencing that blocked the hiking trail
- Redirecting water flow from the mill race for soil testing
- Claiming the River Access Road easement was improperly granted and seeking to have it vacated
- Asserting that all water rights should transfer with their ownership of the "upstream" property

The Miller Family Trust filed for a temporary restraining order, claiming Riverside's actions threatened their business operations and violated their established rights. The Trust argues they have gained title to disputed areas through adverse possession and have superior water rights as the senior appropriator.

Adding complexity to the situation, a 2022 environmental survey revealed that portions of all parties' properties may be within the expanded flood plain under new FEMA regulations, potentially affecting development rights. Additionally, the State Historic Preservation Office has indicated the mill complex may be eligible for historic designation, which could restrict alterations.

# Legal Scenario 04: The Matthews Family Custody and Relocation Dispute

## Case Title
Matthews v. Matthews - Interstate Custody Modification with Relocation Request

## Area of Law
Family Law

## Difficulty Level
Intermediate

## Fact Pattern

Jennifer Matthews, 34, and David Matthews, 36, divorced two years ago after an eight-year marriage. They share custody of their two children: Emma (age 9) and Lucas (age 6). Under their current custody arrangement approved by the Nevada family court, Jennifer has primary physical custody with David having supervised visitation every other weekend and one evening per week. David's visitation was initially supervised due to a domestic violence incident during the marriage, but he has since completed anger management counseling and the supervision requirement was lifted six months ago.

Jennifer recently received a significant job promotion with her employer, a renewable energy consulting firm, requiring her to relocate to Portland, Oregon. The position offers a 40% salary increase and represents a major career advancement opportunity. Jennifer has filed a motion to modify custody to allow relocation with the children, proposing that David receive extended summer visitation and alternating holidays to maintain his relationship with the children.

David strongly opposes the relocation, arguing that it would interfere with his growing relationship with the children and his ability to be involved in their daily lives. He has filed a counter-motion seeking primary custody, claiming that his situation has stabilized significantly. David recently remarried his fianc√©e Sarah Chen, 29, a registered nurse, and they have purchased a four-bedroom home in the same school district where the children currently attend school. David argues that keeping the children in their current environment would provide better stability and continuity.

Complicating matters, Jennifer's mother, Patricia Williams, 62, has been the children's primary caregiver during Jennifer's work hours and has developed a very close relationship with both children. Patricia is concerned about the impact of the move on her relationship with her grandchildren and has retained separate counsel. She is requesting formal grandparent visitation rights regardless of the custody outcome.

The children attend Sunset Elementary School, where Emma is in a gifted program and Lucas receives speech therapy services. Emma has expressed to the court-appointed child advocate that she wants to stay near her friends and her grandmother, while Lucas, who is less verbal due to his speech delays, has not clearly communicated his preferences.

Additional factors include:
- Jennifer's new job would require approximately 25% travel, though she has arranged for her sister in Portland to provide childcare assistance
- David's work as a construction supervisor has recently become more stable, with predictable hours and increased income
- Jennifer has been the children's primary caregiver since birth and maintains strong bonds with both children
- David has been consistent with his visitation and child support payments since the divorce
- The children's pediatrician and therapists are all located in Nevada, and Emma's speech therapy program is specifically designed for her needs

## Case Title
HealthVault Technologies Inc. v. State Privacy Commission and Class Action Plaintiffs

## Area of Law
Privacy and Data Protection Law - Data Breach Notification and HIPAA Compliance

## Difficulty Level
Intermediate

## Fact Pattern

HealthVault Technologies Inc. ("HealthVault") operates a cloud-based electronic health records (EHR) platform serving over 200 small to medium-sized medical practices across three states: California, Texas, and New York. The company stores protected health information (PHI) for approximately 850,000 patients and has been in operation since 2018.

**The Breach Incident:**

On March 15, 2024, HealthVault's security team discovered unusual activity on their network servers. Initial investigation revealed that an unauthorized party had gained access to their database containing patient records through a sophisticated phishing attack that compromised an employee's administrative credentials on February 8, 2024.

The breach involved the following sensitive information:
- Full names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses
- Social Security numbers for 650,000 patients
- Medical record numbers and health insurance information
- Detailed medical histories, diagnoses, and treatment records
- Prescription medication lists and pharmacy information
- Mental health records for 45,000 patients
- Laboratory test results and imaging reports

**Timeline of Discovery and Response:**

**March 15, 2024:** HealthVault's IT Director, Marcus Chen, first noticed suspicious network activity during routine monitoring. Initial investigation suggested possible unauthorized access.

**March 18, 2024:** External cybersecurity firm "SecureGuard Solutions" was hired to conduct comprehensive investigation. Preliminary findings confirmed unauthorized access but scope remained unclear.

**March 25, 2024:** SecureGuard's report confirmed extensive data exfiltration dating back to February 8, 2024. The breach affected approximately 850,000 patient records across all client practices.

**March 28, 2024:** HealthVault's CEO, Dr. Sarah Mitchell, met with legal counsel to discuss notification obligations but decided to "gather more information" before making notifications.

**April 12, 2024:** Dark web monitoring services detected HealthVault patient data being offered for sale on cybercriminal forums, confirming that stolen data had been compromised.

**April 15, 2024:** Local news station KQED received an anonymous tip about the data breach and began investigating. HealthVault's communications director provided "no comment."

**April 18, 2024:** KQED published expose revealing the breach. HealthVault scrambled to begin notification process that same day.

**April 19, 2024:** HealthVault sent initial breach notifications to affected healthcare providers but provided limited details about the scope and timeline of the breach.

**April 25, 2024:** Patient notifications began via mail, but many letters contained inaccurate information about what data was compromised and failed to provide required credit monitoring services.

**May 2, 2024:** California Privacy Commission received HealthVault's breach report - 48 days after initial discovery and 32 days past the state-required notification deadline.

**Additional Complications:**

- HealthVault's incident response plan was last updated in 2020 and didn't account for multi-state notification requirements
- The company's cyber insurance policy had lapsed two months before the breach occurred
- Several medical practices using HealthVault were not immediately notified and learned about the breach through news reports
- HealthVault failed to notify the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) within the required 60-day period
- Patient notification letters were sent only in English, despite 23% of affected patients having Spanish as their primary language
- No credit monitoring services were initially offered, and when finally provided, the enrollment process was confusing and had technical difficulties

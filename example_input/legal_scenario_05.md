## Case Title
Chen v. Meridian Financial Services, LLC and Individual Defendants

## Area of Law
Employment Law - Discrimination and Wrongful Termination

## Difficulty Level
Advanced

## Fact Pattern

Dr. Maya Chen, a 45-year-old Chinese-American woman with a PhD in Economics, was hired as Senior Vice President of Risk Management at Meridian Financial Services in January 2022. Meridian is a mid-sized investment firm with 350 employees, headquartered in Chicago with offices in New York and Los Angeles.

During her first year, Chen consistently received excellent performance reviews and successfully implemented new risk assessment protocols that saved the company an estimated $2.3 million. However, she began experiencing what she perceived as discriminatory treatment from her supervisor, David Morrison (VP of Operations), and CEO James Whitfield.

**Timeline of Key Events:**

**March 2022:** Chen reported to HR Director Sarah Kim that Morrison made several comments about her "not understanding American business culture" and suggested she was "too aggressive for an Asian woman." Morrison also repeatedly mispronounced her name despite corrections.

**June 2022:** Chen was excluded from a critical client meeting with Japanese investors, despite her expertise in Asian markets and fluency in Mandarin. Morrison told her it would be "better to have someone who looks more... mainstream" handle the relationship.

**August 2022:** Chen discovered she was paid $45,000 less than her male predecessor, Tom Bradley, who had similar qualifications but less experience. When she raised this with Morrison, he dismissed her concerns, saying the previous role was "different" and that she should be "grateful for the opportunity."

**October 2022:** Chen filed a formal complaint with HR regarding pay disparity and discriminatory treatment. Three days later, Morrison reassigned her to "special projects" - effectively removing her from her risk management duties.

**December 2022:** Chen took FMLA leave to care for her elderly mother who suffered a stroke. While on leave, she learned that Morrison had told colleagues she was "probably not coming back" and began interviewing replacements.

**February 2023:** Upon her return from leave, Chen found her access to key systems had been revoked, her office had been reassigned, and she was given a desk in a common area. Her new assignment involved creating "diversity reports" - work typically assigned to junior analysts.

**March 2023:** Chen contacted the EEOC and filed charges of discrimination based on race, national origin, and sex, as well as retaliation. Two weeks later, she received a written warning for "failing to complete assigned tasks in a timely manner" - the first negative evaluation in her employment history.

**April 2023:** During a company retreat, CEO Whitfield made remarks at a dinner about "certain employees who don't appreciate our company culture" while looking directly at Chen. When Chen's colleague, Mark Rodriguez (Director of Compliance), privately expressed concern about Chen's treatment, he was subsequently excluded from management meetings.

**May 2023:** Meridian's largest client, Yamamoto Holdings, specifically requested Chen lead their account due to her reputation in the industry. Morrison rejected this request, stating Chen was "not client-facing material." The client ultimately took their business elsewhere, resulting in $1.8 million in lost revenue.

**July 2023:** Chen was terminated, allegedly for "poor performance and failure to adapt to company culture." Her termination letter cited her "inability to work effectively with colleagues" and "resistance to feedback." The same day, the company announced the hiring of a new Senior VP of Risk Management - a 32-year-old white male with less experience than Chen but a personal connection to CEO Whitfield.

**Additional Complications:**

- Chen's replacement, Jake Matthews, is Whitfield's former fraternity brother and was hired at a salary $60,000 higher than Chen's peak compensation.
- Internal emails obtained through discovery reveal Morrison referring to Chen as "Dragon Lady" and expressing concern about "too many minorities in leadership."
- The company's diversity policy, implemented six months after Chen's hiring, includes language about "cultural fit" that may have been used to justify discriminatory actions.
- Three other employees of Asian descent have filed similar complaints with HR in the past two years, but all were quietly settled with non-disclosure agreements.

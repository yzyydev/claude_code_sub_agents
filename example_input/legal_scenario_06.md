## Area of Law
Consumer Protection Law - False Advertising

## Difficulty Level
Beginner

## Fact Pattern

In September 2024, Patricia Johnson, a 42-year-old office manager from Denver, Colorado, saw an advertisement on social media for "SlimFast Ultra," a weight loss supplement sold by NutriMax Wellness Inc. The advertisement featured dramatic before-and-after photos and made several bold claims:

- "Lose 30 pounds in 30 days - GUARANTEED!"
- "Clinically proven to burn fat 5x faster than diet and exercise alone"
- "As seen on TV - recommended by doctors nationwide"
- "100% natural ingredients with no side effects"
- "Thousands of satisfied customers - see results in just 7 days!"

The advertisement also included testimonials from supposed customers, including one from "Dr. Sarah Mitchell" who claimed to be a "certified nutritionist" and stated that SlimFast Ultra was "the most effective weight loss supplement I've ever seen."

Motivated by the promise of rapid weight loss before her daughter's wedding in November, Johnson purchased a three-month supply of SlimFast Ultra for $297, believing she would lose 30 pounds in the first month as advertised.

Johnson followed the supplement regimen exactly as directed for eight weeks. However, she lost only 3 pounds during this period, which was consistent with the modest dietary changes she had made. She experienced no accelerated fat burning and actually suffered from mild stomach upset and headaches, which she attributed to the supplement.

Concerned about the lack of results, Johnson researched NutriMax Wellness Inc. and discovered several troubling facts:

1. The "before and after" photos in the advertisement were stock photos purchased from a modeling website
2. "Dr. Sarah Mitchell" was not a certified nutritionist but an actress hired for the testimonial
3. No clinical studies supported the "5x faster fat burning" claim
4. The supplement contained primarily caffeine and inexpensive herbal fillers
5. The Better Business Bureau had received 47 complaints about NutriMax in the past year for similar advertising practices

Johnson attempted to return the unused supplements for a refund, but NutriMax refused, citing their "terms and conditions" which stated that returns were only accepted for "defective products" and that results would "vary by individual."

Johnson now seeks a full refund of her $297 purchase price, plus additional damages for the false advertising and deceptive marketing practices that led to her purchase.

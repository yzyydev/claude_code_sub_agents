# Legal Scenario 02: SmartFit Wearable Device Malfunction

## Case Title
**Henderson v. TechWear Industries, Inc., et al.**

## Area of Law
**TORT LAW** - Product Liability

## Difficulty Level
**INTERMEDIATE**

## Fact Pattern

Sarah Henderson, a 34-year-old marathon runner and personal trainer, purchased a SmartFit Pro wearable fitness device from ElectroMax retail store in March 2023. The device, manufactured by TechWear Industries, Inc., was marketed as "the ultimate fitness companion with advanced heart rate monitoring and GPS tracking." The product packaging prominently displayed claims of "medical-grade accuracy" and "safe for all-day wear."

Henderson wore the device daily for six months without incident. On September 15, 2023, while conducting a high-intensity training session with her client, Maria Gonzalez, Henderson's SmartFit Pro began overheating severely. The device's lithium battery, manufactured by PowerCell Corp., swelled and caused the device's metal clasp to become extremely hot, reaching temperatures exceeding 150Â°F.

The overheating caused second-degree burns on Henderson's wrist, requiring immediate medical attention and resulting in permanent scarring. During the incident, Henderson instinctively removed the device quickly, causing it to fall and strike Gonzalez in the face, resulting in a minor cut above her eyebrow and temporary vision impairment.

Investigation revealed that TechWear Industries had received 23 similar complaints about overheating in the six months prior to Henderson's incident, but had issued no recalls or warnings. The company's internal emails, obtained through discovery, showed that their engineering team had identified a potential defect in the charging circuitry that could cause battery overheating under certain humidity conditions, but management decided not to issue a recall due to cost concerns.

PowerCell Corp., the battery manufacturer, had provided TechWear with technical specifications indicating that their batteries required specific ventilation and temperature controls. However, TechWear's final product design did not incorporate these safety features to maintain the device's slim profile.

ElectroMax, the retailer, had prominently displayed the SmartFit Pro in their "Professional Athlete" section and trained their sales staff to emphasize the device's professional-grade safety features. Store training materials, later discovered in litigation, contained inaccurate information about the product's safety testing and certifications.

Henderson incurred $15,000 in medical expenses, lost $8,000 in income during her recovery period, and experienced ongoing anxiety about wearing any electronic devices. Gonzalez, though not the primary victim, also seeks compensation for her medical expenses and the trauma of witnessing Henderson's injury.

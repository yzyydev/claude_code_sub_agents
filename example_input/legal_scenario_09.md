# Legal Scenario 09: The Downtown Mixed-Use Development Collapse

## Case Title
Riverside Commons Homeowners Association v. Apex Engineering Group, et al. - Professional Negligence and Cascading Construction Failures

## Area of Law
Tort Law - Professional Negligence with Multiple Defendants

## Difficulty Level
Advanced

## Fact Pattern

In 2019, Riverside Commons, a luxury mixed-use development in downtown Portland, Oregon, was designed as a 12-story building featuring retail space, office floors, and residential condominiums. The $85 million project involved multiple professional service providers working under tight deadlines to meet the city's urban renewal incentives.

**The Professional Team:**

**Apex Engineering Group** served as the structural engineer. Principal Engineer Marcus Webb, PE, had 15 years of experience but had never designed a building over 8 stories. Apex subcontracted the foundation design to **Bedrock Foundation Specialists**, a newer firm led by Sarah Kim, PE, who specialized in challenging soil conditions but had limited high-rise experience.

**Morrison & Associates Architects** designed the building's architectural elements. Lead Architect Jennifer Morrison, AIA, pushed for an innovative cantilever design on the 8th floor to create dramatic overhangs, despite Apex's initial concerns about load distribution.

**Precision Construction Management** served as the general contractor, with site supervisor Tony Rodriguez overseeing daily operations. **Pacific Steel Fabricators** was subcontracted to manufacture and install the structural steel framework.

**The Sequence of Events:**

During the design phase (2019), Apex's structural analysis contained several critical errors:
1. Webb miscalculated load-bearing requirements for the cantilever design, underestimating wind loads by 35%
2. The team failed to properly account for dynamic loads from the building's mixed-use nature
3. Kim at Bedrock Foundation Specialists identified problematic soil conditions but recommended inadequate foundation reinforcement to keep costs down

Morrison & Associates received Apex's structural plans and noticed some concerning beam specifications but failed to question them, assuming Apex had properly calculated the requirements. Morrison also made unauthorized modifications to the cantilever design without consulting Apex, extending the overhang by an additional 4 feet to enhance the building's aesthetic appeal.

During construction (2020-2021), several issues arose:
- Pacific Steel Fabricators discovered that the specified steel beams were insufficient for the loads but proceeded with installation after Precision Construction Management instructed them to "stick to the plans"
- Rodriguez noticed concerning deflection during construction but failed to halt work or report concerns to the design team
- The city building inspector, overwhelmed with pandemic-related staffing shortages, conducted only cursory inspections

**The Failure:**

In September 2023, during a severe windstorm (winds reached 75 mph), the building experienced catastrophic partial collapse. The cantilever section on the 8th floor collapsed, pancaking down through floors 7, 6, and 5. The failure killed 3 residents, injured 27 others, and caused complete evacuation of the building.

**Post-Incident Investigation:**

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) investigation revealed:
1. Apex's structural calculations contained fundamental errors in wind load analysis
2. The unauthorized architectural modifications created additional loads never accounted for in structural design
3. Bedrock's foundation design was inadequate for the building's actual loads, contributing to overall structural instability
4. Pacific Steel Fabricators' steel connections failed to meet code requirements, though they followed the (inadequate) design specifications
5. Multiple opportunities existed for professionals to identify and correct the design flaws

The building is now condemned, leaving 156 residential units uninhabitable and 40 commercial tenants displaced.

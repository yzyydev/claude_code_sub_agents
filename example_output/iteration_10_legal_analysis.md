### **RULE STATEMENTS**

#### **Ohio Warranty of Habitability Law**

**Statutory Framework:**
Under Ohio Revised Code § 5321.04, landlords must:
- Keep premises in habitable condition
- Make necessary repairs to maintain habitability
- Maintain heating systems in good working order
- Respond reasonably to tenant complaints about habitability issues

**Case Law Development:**
Ohio courts recognize an implied warranty of habitability in residential leases. *Shroades v. Rental Homes, Inc.*, 68 Ohio St.3d 20 (1993). The warranty requires landlords to maintain rental premises in condition suitable for human habitation.

**Heating Requirements:**
Ohio law requires landlords to provide adequate heating capable of maintaining 68°F in all living spaces during heating season (typically October 1 through May 1). *Columbus City Code § 4101.05*; *Toledo Municipal Code § 1442.09*.

#### **Constructive Eviction Doctrine**

**Elements of Constructive Eviction:**
Under Ohio law, constructive eviction occurs when:
1. Landlord's conduct substantially interferes with tenant's beneficial use of premises
2. Conditions make premises uninhabitable or significantly interfere with intended use
3. Tenant vacates premises within reasonable time after conditions develop
4. Tenant provides landlord reasonable notice and opportunity to cure

*Reid v. Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co.*, 40 Ohio St.2d 37 (1974).

**Notice Requirements:**
Tenant must provide written notice specifying defects and reasonable time for cure before claiming constructive eviction. *Johnson v. Norris*, 190 Ohio App.3d 264 (2010).

#### **Security Deposit Law**

**Ohio Revised Code § 5321.16 - Security Deposit Requirements:**
- Landlord must return security deposit within 30 days of lease termination
- Deductions limited to:
  - Unpaid rent
  - Damage beyond normal wear and tear
  - Other damages specified in lease
- Landlord must provide itemized list of deductions
- Improper retention subjects landlord to damages and attorney fees

**Normal Wear and Tear Definition:**
Normal wear and tear includes deterioration from ordinary use without negligence, carelessness, accident, or abuse. *Pinney v. Ragusa*, 119 Ohio App.3d 278 (1997).

Examples of normal wear and tear:
- Minor carpet wear from foot traffic
- Small nail holes from pictures
- Minor scuff marks
- Fading paint

Examples of tenant damage:
- Large stains or burns in carpet
- Holes in walls larger than nail holes
- Excessive dirt requiring professional cleaning beyond normal cleaning

#### **Tenant Remedies for Landlord Breach**

**Available Remedies under Ohio Law:**
1. **Actual Damages:** Cost of repairs, temporary housing, moving expenses
2. **Security Deposit Return:** Plus interest and penalties for improper retention
3. **Rent Reduction:** Proportional reduction for period of uninhabitable conditions
4. **Attorney Fees:** In security deposit cases under § 5321.16
5. **Punitive Damages:** In cases of willful misconduct

### **APPLICATION AND ANALYSIS**

#### **Analysis 1: Warranty of Habitability Breach**

**Factual Analysis:**
The heating system's failure to maintain temperatures above 58-62°F clearly falls below Ohio's standard requiring 68°F capability. Johnson documented daily temperatures showing consistent failure to reach habitable levels. The timing of the problem (October through December) coincides with Ohio's heating season when adequate heating is legally required.

**Landlord's Response Analysis:**
Pine Street Properties' response was inadequate under Ohio law:
- **Delayed Response:** Three days with no action followed by promises of eventual service
- **Dismissive Attitude:** Chen's suggestion that tenant was "too picky" and should use space heaters
- **No Repair Attempts:** Despite multiple complaints and written notice, no repair person ever examined the system
- **Failure to Respond to Formal Notice:** No response to November 15 certified letter demanding repairs

**Legal Conclusion on Habitability:**
Pine Street Properties clearly breached the warranty of habitability. The heating system's failure to maintain required temperatures, combined with landlord's inadequate response, establishes a substantial breach affecting habitability.

**Strength of Claim:** Strong. Well-documented temperature records and landlord's clear disregard for repair obligations support this claim.

#### **Analysis 2: Constructive Eviction**

**Notice and Opportunity to Cure:**
Johnson provided multiple forms of notice:
- Immediate phone calls reporting problem
- Follow-up calls after delays
- Written email detailing problems
- Certified letter on November 15 giving 30 days to cure

The certified letter specifically stated that failure to repair would result in lease termination, providing clear notice of consequences.

**Landlord's Opportunity to Cure:**
Pine Street Properties had over two months (October 15 to December 20) to address the heating problem. The 30-day cure period in the certified letter provided additional formal opportunity. Landlord's complete failure to attempt repairs demonstrates clear breach.

**Vacation of Premises:**
Johnson remained in the apartment for approximately two months after the problem began, attempting to work with the landlord. Her December 20 notice and January 15 move-out represents reasonable timing under constructive eviction doctrine.

**Substantial Interference with Use:**
Inability to maintain habitable temperatures in a studio apartment during Ohio winter substantially interferes with basic residential use. This goes beyond minor inconvenience to fundamental habitability.

**Legal Conclusion on Constructive Eviction:**
Johnson has strong grounds for constructive eviction claim. She provided adequate notice, gave reasonable cure period, and vacated within reasonable time after landlord's clear breach.

**Strength of Claim:** Strong. All elements of constructive eviction are satisfied with good documentation.

#### **Analysis 3: Security Deposit Analysis**

**Deduction Analysis:**

**1. Carpet Cleaning ($200):**
- **Legal Standard:** Must be damage beyond normal wear and tear
- **Factual Analysis:** No evidence of stains, damage, or excessive dirt beyond normal use
- **Duration:** Johnson lived in apartment only 4.5 months
- **Conclusion:** Likely normal wear and tear; improper deduction

**2. Wall Touch-up Paint ($150):**
- **Legal Standard:** Minor nail holes and scuff marks are normal wear and tear
- **Factual Analysis:** No evidence of excessive damage requiring painting
- **Duration:** Short-term tenancy unlikely to require repainting
- **Conclusion:** Likely normal wear and tear; improper deduction

**3. Cleaning Fee ($100):**
- **Legal Standard:** Basic cleaning upon move-out is tenant responsibility, but professional cleaning for normal use is landlord's cost
- **Factual Analysis:** Johnson maintained apartment in clean condition per her claims
- **Conclusion:** Without evidence of excessive cleaning needs, likely improper deduction

**4. Early Lease Termination Penalty ($500):**
- **Legal Analysis:** If constructive eviction occurred, tenant is not liable for early termination penalties
- **Landlord's Breach:** Constructive eviction relieves tenant of lease obligations
- **Conclusion:** Improper deduction if constructive eviction is established

**Overall Security Deposit Analysis:**
All deductions appear improper. The claimed damages represent normal wear and tear for a short-term tenancy, and early termination penalty is invalid if tenant was constructively evicted.

**Strength of Claim:** Strong. Landlord's deductions lack factual support and legal basis.

#### **Analysis 4: Tenant's Damages and Remedies**

**Security Deposit Recovery:**
Johnson is entitled to return of full $950 security deposit plus potential penalties under Ohio § 5321.16 for improper retention.

**Additional Damages:**
1. **Space Heater Costs:** $280 - reasonable mitigation expenses
2. **Increased Utility Costs:** $135/month × 3 months = $405 additional electricity costs
3. **Moving Expenses:** Reasonable costs for early move necessitated by landlord breach
4. **Attorney Fees:** Available under security deposit statute

**Potential Damage Calculation:**
- Security deposit return: $950
- Space heater costs: $280
- Additional utilities: $405
- Moving expenses: $500 (estimated)
- **Total potential recovery:** $2,135 plus attorney fees

**Mitigation Analysis:**
Johnson's purchase of space heaters and continued occupancy for reasonable period demonstrates proper mitigation efforts. She attempted to make situation workable while pursuing landlord remedies.

### **CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS**

#### **Predicted Outcomes:**

**1. Warranty of Habitability Claim: LIKELY TO SUCCEED**
Strong evidence of landlord's failure to maintain required heating standards with well-documented temperature records and inadequate landlord response.

**2. Constructive Eviction Claim: LIKELY TO SUCCEED**
All elements satisfied: substantial interference, adequate notice, reasonable cure period, and timely vacation of premises.

**3. Security Deposit Recovery: VERY LIKELY TO SUCCEED**
Landlord's deductions lack legal basis and appear to represent normal wear and tear or invalid penalties.

**4. Additional Damages: MODERATELY LIKELY TO SUCCEED**
Space heater and utility costs are reasonable and well-documented mitigation expenses directly caused by landlord's breach.

#### **Strategic Recommendations for Johnson:**

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Gather Documentation:** Compile temperature records, utility bills, receipts for space heaters, and all correspondence with landlord
2. **Calculate Damages:** Prepare detailed accounting of all costs incurred due to landlord's breach
3. **Legal Consultation:** Consider consulting with landlord-tenant attorney, especially given potential for attorney fee recovery

**Litigation Strategy:**
1. **Demand Letter:** Send comprehensive demand letter seeking full security deposit return plus damages
2. **Small Claims Option:** Ohio small claims courts handle landlord-tenant disputes up to $3,000
3. **Statutory Penalties:** Pursue penalties under security deposit statute for improper retention

**Settlement Considerations:**
Johnson holds strong legal position. Reasonable settlement might include:
- Full security deposit return ($950)
- Reimbursement for space heaters ($280)
- Partial utility cost reimbursement ($200-400)
- **Total settlement range:** $1,400-1,600

#### **Risk Assessment for Pine Street Properties:**

**Legal Exposure:**
- Security deposit return plus statutory penalties
- Tenant's actual damages for breach
- Potential attorney fees
- **Estimated exposure:** $2,000-3,000 plus attorney fees

**Defenses Available (Weak):**
- Claim heating system was functional (contradicted by temperature records)
- Argue deductions were proper (difficult given normal wear and tear standards)
- Claim tenant didn't provide adequate notice (contradicted by documented communications)

#### **Property Law Learning Points:**

**Key Principles Demonstrated:**
1. **Implied Warranty of Habitability:** Landlords must maintain rental premises in habitable condition regardless of lease terms
2. **Constructive Eviction:** Tenants can terminate leases when landlord conduct makes premises uninhabitable
3. **Security Deposit Protection:** Strong tenant protections against improper deposit retention
4. **Notice and Cure Requirements:** Proper notice procedures are essential for tenant remedies

**Practical Client Counseling Considerations:**
1. **Documentation Importance:** Johnson's temperature records and correspondence created strong evidentiary foundation
2. **Reasonable Response:** Purchase of space heaters showed reasonable mitigation while pursuing remedies
3. **Timing Matters:** Johnson's patience with landlord followed by decisive action when repair period expired demonstrates balanced approach

**Professional Responsibility Notes:**
Attorney representing Johnson should:
- Thoroughly document all damages with supporting records
- Consider cost-benefit analysis of litigation versus settlement
- Advise client about small claims versus general jurisdiction options
- Ensure compliance with applicable statute of limitations

#### **Broader Legal Context:**

This case exemplifies common landlord-tenant disputes involving habitability and security deposits. It demonstrates how property law protects tenants through:
- Implied warranties that cannot be waived
- Constructive eviction doctrine providing remedy for uninhabitable conditions
- Statutory protections for security deposits with penalty provisions

The case also illustrates importance of proper documentation and communication in landlord-tenant relationships, showing how Johnson's methodical approach to notice and documentation created strong legal foundation for her claims.

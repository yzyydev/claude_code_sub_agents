## RULE STATEMENTS

### A. Strict Product Liability

#### Elements of Strict Liability Claim
Under Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability § 1, a plaintiff must establish:
1. The defendant sold or distributed the product commercially
2. The product was defective when it left the defendant's control
3. The defect caused the plaintiff's harm
4. The plaintiff suffered damages

#### Types of Product Defects
**Manufacturing Defects (§ 2(a)):** Product departs from intended design and is more dangerous than consumers expect.

**Design Defects (§ 2(b)):** Product's design renders it not reasonably safe, established through either:
- Consumer expectation test: Product failed to perform as safely as ordinary consumer would expect
- Risk-utility test: Risks of harm outweigh the product's utility

**Warning Defects (§ 2(c)):** Failure to provide adequate instructions or warnings about risks that could be reduced or avoided by reasonable instructions or warnings.

### B. Chain of Distribution Liability

#### Manufacturer Liability
Primary manufacturers bear strict liability for defective products regardless of negligence. *Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc.*, 59 Cal.2d 57 (1963).

#### Component Manufacturer Liability
Component manufacturers may be liable when:
1. The component itself is defective, or
2. The component manufacturer substantially participates in the integration of the component into the design of the final product and the integration causes the product to be defective

*Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability § 5.*

#### Retailer/Distributor Liability
Retailers and distributors in the chain of distribution are subject to strict liability even without fault. *Escola v. Coca Cola Bottling Co.*, 24 Cal.2d 453 (1944).

### C. Negligence in Product Liability Context

#### Manufacturer's Duty of Care
Manufacturers owe a duty of reasonable care in:
1. Product design and testing
2. Manufacturing processes
3. Providing adequate warnings and instructions
4. Post-sale duty to warn of discovered dangers

#### Knowledge and Foreseeability
When a manufacturer has actual or constructive knowledge of a product's dangerous propensity, the duty to warn is triggered. *Finnegan v. Havir Manufacturing Corp.*, 60 N.J. 413 (1972).

### D. Misrepresentation and Warranty Claims

#### Express Warranty
Under UCC § 2-313, express warranties are created by:
1. Affirmations of fact or promises about the goods
2. Descriptions of the goods
3. Samples or models

#### Negligent Misrepresentation
Elements include:
1. False representation of material fact
2. Defendant's failure to exercise reasonable care in obtaining or communicating information
3. Justifiable reliance by plaintiff
4. Damages proximately caused by the misrepresentation

## APPLICATION AND ANALYSIS

### I. Product Liability Claims Against TechWear Industries, Inc.

#### A. Strict Liability Analysis

**Manufacturing Defect Claim:**
The facts suggest a strong manufacturing defect claim. The SmartFit Pro device departed from its intended design when the charging circuitry defect caused dangerous overheating. The device's performance—reaching 150°F and causing second-degree burns—clearly exceeds what ordinary consumers would expect from a fitness wearable.

TechWear's knowledge of 23 similar complaints indicates this was not an isolated manufacturing error but a systematic defect affecting multiple units. The product was undeniably more dangerous than consumers would reasonably expect, satisfying the consumer expectation test.

**Design Defect Analysis:**
A design defect claim faces more complex analysis. Under the risk-utility test, courts would balance:

*Factors Supporting Design Defect:*
- TechWear prioritized slim profile over safety by omitting required ventilation and temperature controls
- Alternative safer designs were available (incorporating PowerCell's recommended safety features)
- The marginal utility of a slimmer profile is outweighed by serious burn risks

*Factors Against Design Defect:*
- Consumer awareness that electronic devices generate heat
- The device performed as intended for six months before failure
- Industry standards may not require the specific safety features PowerCell recommended

The strongest design defect argument focuses on TechWear's conscious decision to ignore PowerCell's safety specifications. This represents a cost-benefit analysis that prioritized aesthetics over user safety.

**Warning Defect - Failure to Warn:**
This presents TechWear's most significant exposure. The company had actual knowledge of the overheating danger through 23 prior complaints and internal engineering analysis. Despite this knowledge, TechWear failed to:
1. Issue recalls or safety warnings
2. Provide adequate instructions about humidity-related risks
3. Alert consumers to discontinue use if overheating occurred

The post-sale duty to warn was clearly triggered by TechWear's actual knowledge of the danger, making their silence legally indefensible.

#### B. Negligence Claims

**Negligent Design:**
TechWear's decision to disregard PowerCell's safety specifications constitutes negligent design. A reasonable manufacturer would incorporate safety features recommended by component suppliers, particularly when the cost of implementation is minimal compared to potential harm.

**Negligent Failure to Warn:**
With actual knowledge of the defect and 23 prior incidents, TechWear's failure to warn constitutes clear negligence. The company breached its duty of reasonable care by prioritizing cost considerations over consumer safety.

### II. Component Manufacturer Liability - PowerCell Corp.

#### Analysis of PowerCell's Liability Exposure

PowerCell's liability presents a more nuanced analysis. Under Restatement (Third) § 5, component manufacturers face liability when they substantially participate in the integration process that creates the defective condition.

**Arguments Against PowerCell Liability:**
- PowerCell provided clear safety specifications requiring ventilation and temperature controls
- The battery itself was not defective when used according to specifications
- TechWear, not PowerCell, made the design decision to omit safety features
- PowerCell had no control over final product design

**Arguments For PowerCell Liability:**
- If PowerCell knew TechWear planned to omit safety features and continued supplying batteries, this could constitute substantial participation in creating the dangerous condition
- Component manufacturers have obligations to ensure their products are safely integrated

**Likely Outcome:** PowerCell has strong defenses based on TechWear's failure to follow specifications. However, discovery may reveal whether PowerCell knew of TechWear's design decisions and continued supplying components despite safety concerns.

### III. Retailer Liability - ElectroMax

#### Strict Liability as Distributor

ElectroMax faces clear strict liability exposure as a commercial seller in the distribution chain. Under *Escola* and its progeny, retailers are liable regardless of fault when selling defective products.

**ElectroMax cannot avoid liability by arguing:**
- They had no knowledge of the defect
- They did not manufacture the product
- They merely sold the product as received

#### Enhanced Liability Through Misrepresentation

ElectroMax's liability extends beyond basic distributor liability due to their affirmative misrepresentations:

1. **Placement in "Professional Athlete" section** implied enhanced safety and reliability
2. **Sales staff training** emphasized "professional-grade safety features" 
3. **Training materials contained inaccurate safety information**

These actions constitute negligent misrepresentation, creating liability independent of product defects. ElectroMax made affirmative representations about safety that exceeded the manufacturer's claims and were factually inaccurate.

### IV. Multi-Party Liability Allocation

#### Joint and Several Liability

Under traditional joint and several liability principles, Henderson can recover her full damages from any defendant, leaving them to sort out contribution among themselves.

**Factors Affecting Contribution:**
1. **TechWear Industries:** Primary liability as manufacturer with actual knowledge who failed to warn
2. **ElectroMax:** Secondary liability as distributor with enhanced exposure due to misrepresentations
3. **PowerCell Corp:** Minimal liability exposure if they properly specified safety requirements

#### Comparative Fault Analysis

In jurisdictions applying comparative fault to strict liability:
- TechWear likely bears 70-80% responsibility due to knowledge and failure to warn
- ElectroMax bears 15-25% responsibility as distributor with misrepresentation
- PowerCell bears 0-10% responsibility depending on their knowledge of design defects

### V. Causation Analysis

#### Factual Causation
Henderson can establish factual causation through the "but for" test—but for the defective charging circuitry, the overheating and burns would not have occurred. The six-month period of normal use followed by sudden failure supports this causal link.

#### Proximate Causation
The burns were a direct and foreseeable consequence of the overheating defect. Product liability law specifically contemplates injuries from defective products, making Henderson's injuries clearly within the scope of liability.

**Gonzalez's Causation Issues:**
Gonzalez faces more complex causation analysis as an indirect victim. Her injuries resulted from Henderson's reaction to the defective product rather than direct contact with the product itself. However, courts often find sufficient proximate causation when:
1. The indirect injury was a foreseeable consequence of the product defect
2. The plaintiff was in the immediate vicinity and at risk from the defective product
3. The chain of causation was unbroken

### VI. Damages Analysis

#### Henderson's Recoverable Damages

**Economic Damages:**
- Medical expenses: $15,000 (easily recoverable with documentation)
- Lost income: $8,000 (recoverable with proof of earnings and recovery period)
- Future medical expenses for scar treatment (if reasonably necessary)

**Non-Economic Damages:**
- Pain and suffering from second-degree burns
- Permanent scarring and disfigurement
- Ongoing anxiety about electronic devices (psychological injury)

#### Gonzalez's Recoverable Damages

As an indirect victim, Gonzalez can likely recover:
- Medical expenses for facial injury treatment
- Pain and suffering for physical injury and temporary vision impairment
- Emotional distress from witnessing Henderson's injury (if jurisdiction recognizes bystander emotional distress claims)

Her damages will be significantly lower than Henderson's due to the minor nature of her physical injuries.

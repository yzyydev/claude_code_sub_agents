## II. RULE STATEMENTS AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK

### A. Professional Negligence Standards

#### Elements of Professional Negligence
To establish professional negligence, plaintiffs must prove:
1. **Duty** - Defendant owed a professional duty of care
2. **Breach** - Defendant's conduct fell below professional standard of care
3. **Causation** - Defendant's breach was both factual and legal cause of harm
4. **Damages** - Plaintiff suffered compensable harm

*See Ramp v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co.*, 269 Or. 540, 525 P.2d 680 (1974) (establishing Oregon professional negligence framework).

#### Professional Standard of Care
The standard of care for professionals is typically defined as "that degree of care, skill, and diligence used by members of the same profession in good standing in the same or similar locality, under similar circumstances."

**For Engineers:** Professional engineers must exercise the skill and learning commonly possessed by members of the profession in good standing. *Mattingly v. Sheldon Jackson College*, 743 P.2d 356 (Alaska 1987).

**For Architects:** Architects must use reasonable care in providing services consistent with professional standards in the community. *City of Mounds View v. Walijarvi*, 263 N.W.2d 420 (Minn. 1978).

**For Contractors:** General contractors owe a duty to perform work in a workmanlike manner and to exercise reasonable care in construction supervision. *Kriegler v. Eichler Homes, Inc.*, 269 Cal. App. 2d 224, 74 Cal. Rptr. 749 (1969).

#### Professional Liability Specific Considerations

**Limiting Liability to Third Parties:** Professional relationships may limit liability to parties not in privity of contract. However, construction professionals may owe duties to reasonably foreseeable third parties. *A.E. Investment Corp. v. Link Builders, Inc.*, 62 Wis. 2d 479, 214 N.W.2d 764 (1974).

**Economic Loss Doctrine:** Pure economic losses may not be recoverable in tort absent special circumstances. However, property damage and personal injury typically support tort claims. *Seely v. White Motor Co.*, 63 Cal. 2d 9, 403 P.2d 145 (1965).

### B. Causation in Multi-Defendant Cases

#### Factual Causation (But-For Test)
Each defendant's conduct must be a factual cause of the harm - meaning the harm would not have occurred "but for" the defendant's negligence. In cases with multiple sufficient conditions, courts may apply the "substantial factor" test.

*See Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical and Emotional Harm § 26 (2010).*

#### Legal Causation (Proximate Cause)
Legal causation requires that the harm be within the scope of liability - typically those harms that are reasonably foreseeable consequences of the defendant's conduct.

**Intervening Causes:** Subsequent negligent acts by other parties do not necessarily break the chain of causation if such acts were reasonably foreseeable. *Watson v. Kentucky & Indiana Bridge & R.R. Co.*, 137 Ky. 619, 126 S.W. 146 (1910).

#### Burden of Proof in Complex Causation
When multiple defendants contribute to an indivisible harm, the burden may shift to defendants to prove divisibility of harm. *Summers v. Tice*, 33 Cal. 2d 80, 199 P.2d 1 (1948).

### C. Joint and Several Liability

#### Traditional Rule
Under traditional joint and several liability, each defendant who is jointly liable for an indivisible harm is responsible for the entire judgment, regardless of their percentage of fault.

#### Comparative Fault Modifications
Many jurisdictions have modified joint and several liability:

**Oregon Approach:** Oregon has adopted a modified system where joint and several liability applies only when a defendant is more than 25% at fault. Or. Rev. Stat. § 31.610 (2019).

**Economic vs. Non-Economic Damages:** Some states limit joint and several liability to non-economic damages only. *See* Cal. Civ. Code § 1431.2.

### D. Governmental Immunity

#### Oregon Tort Claims Act
Oregon has waived governmental immunity for tort claims but retains discretionary function immunity. Or. Rev. Stat. §§ 30.260-30.300.

**Ministerial vs. Discretionary Functions:** Building inspections may be ministerial functions not protected by immunity if they involve application of specific standards rather than policy decisions. *Brennen v. City of Eugene*, 285 Or. 401, 591 P.2d 719 (1979).

## III. APPLICATION AND ANALYSIS

### A. Professional Negligence Analysis by Defendant

#### 1. Apex Engineering Group and Marcus Webb

**Duty Analysis:**
Apex clearly owed professional duties to multiple parties:
- Contractual duties to the developer/owner
- Professional duties to building occupants and users under *MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.* principle
- Statutory duties under Oregon engineering licensing requirements

**Breach Analysis:**
Strong evidence of breach exists:
- **Calculation Errors:** 35% underestimation of wind loads represents a fundamental error below professional standards
- **Experience Limitations:** Webb's lack of high-rise experience, while not dispositive, supports negligence finding when combined with errors
- **Quality Control Failures:** Failure to implement adequate peer review processes for complex design

**Expert Testimony:** Professional negligence will require expert testimony comparing Apex's work to accepted engineering standards. The NIST investigation provides strong foundation for such testimony.

**Causation Analysis:**
- **Factual Causation:** Clear but-for causation - building would not have collapsed with proper structural calculations
- **Legal Causation:** Structural failure from wind loads was precisely the type of harm the professional duty was designed to prevent

#### 2. Bedrock Foundation Specialists and Sarah Kim

**Duty and Breach:**
- Specialized duty to provide adequate foundation design for building loads
- Breach evidenced by foundation inadequacy revealed in NIST investigation
- Cost-cutting motivation does not excuse professional negligence

**Causation Complexity:**
- Foundation inadequacy contributed to "overall structural instability" 
- More difficult to establish but-for causation compared to Apex
- Likely substantial factor in overall collapse even if not sole cause

**Damages Apportionment:**
- May bear lesser liability percentage than primary structural engineer
- Contributing factor rather than primary cause analysis

#### 3. Morrison & Associates and Jennifer Morrison

**Unique Breach Issues:**
- **Unauthorized Modifications:** Extending cantilever by 4 feet without engineering consultation represents clear professional breach
- **Coordination Failures:** Architects have duty to coordinate with other professionals
- **Knowledge of Risk:** "Noticing concerning beam specifications" creates duty to investigate

**Causation Analysis:**
- **Direct Causation:** Unauthorized modifications directly contributed to structural failure
- **Intervening Cause Defense:** May argue Apex should have caught the modifications, but foreseeability of engineer reliance defeats this defense

**Professional Standard:**
- Architectural standard requires coordination with structural professionals for modifications affecting structural integrity
- Aesthetic concerns do not justify compromising structural safety

#### 4. Precision Construction Management and Tony Rodriguez

**Construction Phase Duties:**
- Duty to supervise construction according to professional standards
- Duty to halt work when safety concerns arise
- Duty to communicate problems to design professionals

**Critical Breach Evidence:**
- **Observed Deflection:** Rodriguez "noticed concerning deflection" but failed to act
- **Knowledge of Problems:** Instruction to "stick to the plans" despite known steel inadequacy
- **Failure to Communicate:** No evidence of reporting concerns to design team

**Causation Analysis:**
- **Multiple Opportunities:** Construction phase provided multiple chances to prevent disaster
- **Last Clear Chance:** May bear significant liability as final opportunity to prevent harm
- **Comparative Fault:** Likely to argue design professionals bear primary responsibility

#### 5. Pacific Steel Fabricators

**Specialized Contractor Analysis:**
- **Following Plans Defense:** Strong argument that fabricator properly followed design specifications
- **Duty to Warn:** Potential duty to warn of obvious design deficiencies
- **Code Compliance:** NIST finding that connections "failed to meet code requirements" despite following plans creates liability exposure

**Causation Challenges:**
- Most likely to avoid liability as following design specifications
- May face liability only for connection failures beyond design specifications

### B. Multi-Defendant Causation Analysis

#### Concurrent Causation Issues
This case presents classic concurrent causation where multiple independent negligent acts contribute to a single indivisible harm:

1. **Design Phase Errors:** Apex (structural), Bedrock (foundation), Morrison (architectural modifications)
2. **Construction Phase Failures:** Precision (supervision), Pacific Steel (fabrication), City (inspection)

#### Substantial Factor Test Application
Each defendant's conduct was likely a substantial factor in the collapse:
- **Apex:** Primary structural calculation errors
- **Morrison:** Unauthorized load-increasing modifications  
- **Precision:** Failure to halt construction despite known problems
- Others contributed but may be lesser factors

#### Joint and Several Liability Application
Under Oregon law (Or. Rev. Stat. § 31.610):
- Defendants with >25% fault face joint and several liability
- Defendants with <25% fault liable only for their proportionate share
- Likely candidates for >25% fault: Apex, possibly Morrison and Precision

### C. Damages Analysis

#### Personal Injury/Wrongful Death
- **3 Deaths:** Substantial wrongful death damages under Oregon law
- **27 Injuries:** Range from minor to catastrophic personal injury claims
- **Pain and Suffering:** Non-economic damages available in Oregon

#### Property Damage
- **Building Replacement:** $85 million construction cost as baseline
- **Code Upgrades:** Modern building requirements may increase reconstruction costs
- **Lost Value:** Diminished property values in surrounding area

#### Economic Losses
- **Business Interruption:** 40 commercial tenants with ongoing losses
- **Relocation Costs:** Temporary housing and business relocation expenses
- **Lost Rental Income:** Ongoing losses from uninhabitable units

#### Punitive Damages Analysis
Oregon allows punitive damages for gross negligence or willful misconduct. Potential candidates:
- Rodriguez's decision to continue construction despite known deflection problems
- Morrison's unauthorized structural modifications
- Less likely for professional calculation errors absent reckless conduct

### D. Defenses and Mitigation

#### Comparative Fault Among Defendants
Each defendant will likely argue other parties bear primary responsibility:
- **Design Professionals:** Point to construction phase failures
- **Construction Professionals:** Argue design deficiencies were primary cause
- **Specialty Contractors:** Claim they followed specifications

#### Statute of Limitations
Oregon has specific limitation periods for professional negligence:
- **Discovery Rule:** Claim accrues when damage discovered or reasonably should have been discovered
- **Ultimate Repose:** 10-year limit from substantial completion for construction defects
- 2023 collapse likely within limitation periods for 2020-2021 construction

#### Insurance Coverage Issues
Professional liability policies may contain:
- **Aggregate Limits:** Multiple claims may exhaust policy limits
- **Exclusions:** Some policies exclude certain types of damages
- **Duty to Defend:** Insurers must defend claims within policy coverage

# Claude Multi-Agent: Iterative Sub-Agent Orchestration System

A sophisticated project exploring the limits and capabilities of Claude Code for infinite-scale iterative task execution through parallel sub-agent coordination.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project pushes the boundaries of what's possible with Claude Code by implementing a multi-agent orchestration system that can spawn and coordinate unlimited sub-agents to tackle complex, iterative tasks. The system demonstrates how to break through traditional single-agent limitations by leveraging Claude Code's command system for sophisticated parallel processing.

**Core Innovation**: Transform single-threaded AI assistance into a distributed, self-coordinating agent network capable of handling tasks of arbitrary complexity and scale.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system is built around three core command modules in `/.claude/commands/`:

### Command System Overview

```
/.claude/commands/
├── start.md    # Infinite agentic loop orchestrator
├── solve.md    # Specialized parallel case processor  
└── prime.md    # Context window management utilities
```

Each command implements sophisticated agent coordination patterns:

- **Wave-based Generation**: Deploy agents in strategic batches to manage context limits
- **Parallel Task Distribution**: Assign unique creative directions to maximize output diversity
- **Context Optimization**: Progressive summarization and state management across agent waves
- **Quality Coordination**: Ensure uniqueness and value across concurrent outputs

## 📋 Command Reference

### `/start` - Infinite Agentic Loop
**Purpose**: General-purpose iterative content generation with unlimited scalability

**Usage**: 
```bash
/start <spec_file> <output_dir> <count>
```

**Parameters**:
- `spec_file`: Markdown specification defining content requirements
- `output_dir`: Target directory for generated iterations  
- `count`: Number of iterations (1-N or "infinite")

**Key Features**:
- **Intelligent Agent Distribution**: 1-5 agents for small tasks, batched deployment for larger scales
- **Parallel Coordination**: Prevents duplicate concepts across concurrent streams
- **Context Management**: Wave-based generation for sustained infinite output
- **Quality Assurance**: Each iteration builds meaningfully on previous work

### `/solve` - Legal Case Analysis Engine
**Purpose**: Parallel processing of legal scenarios with sophisticated analysis

**Usage**:
```bash
/solve <spec_file> <input_dir> <output_dir>
```

**Parameters**:
- `spec_file`: Legal analysis specification (see `specs/law_example.md`)
- `input_dir`: Directory containing legal scenario files
- `output_dir`: Target directory for analysis outputs

**Key Features**:
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatically detects input file count and deploys appropriate agent count
- **Specialized Assignment**: Each agent receives unique legal scenario and analysis focus
- **Professional Output**: Generates comprehensive legal analyses following IRAC methodology
- **Batch Processing**: Handles 1-20+ legal cases simultaneously

### `/prime` - Context Window Management
**Purpose**: Optimize context usage for extended agent sessions

**Commands**:
- Lists project files for context awareness
- Pre-loads essential documentation
- Manages memory efficiency across agent waves

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Iterative Generation
```bash
# Generate 5 iterations of content based on specification
/start specs/content_spec.md output/ 5
```

### Infinite Mode Execution
```bash
# Run until context limits, generating maximum valuable output
/start specs/advanced_spec.md infinite_output/ infinite
```

### Legal Case Analysis
```bash
# Process all legal scenarios in parallel
/solve specs/law_example.md example_input/ example_output/
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Agent Coordination Patterns

**Parallel Task Specification**:
```markdown
TASK: Generate iteration [NUMBER] for [SPEC_FILE] in [OUTPUT_DIR]

You are Sub Agent [X] generating iteration [NUMBER].

CONTEXT:
- Specification: [Full spec analysis]
- Existing iterations: [Summary of current output_dir contents]  
- Your iteration number: [NUMBER]
- Assigned creative direction: [Specific innovation dimension]

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Read and understand the specification completely
2. Analyze existing iterations to ensure uniqueness
3. Generate content following spec format exactly
4. Focus on assigned innovation dimension
5. Create file with exact naming pattern
6. Ensure genuine value and novelty
```

**Context Management Strategy**:
- **Fresh Agent Instances**: Each wave uses clean context to avoid accumulation
- **Lightweight State Tracking**: Main orchestrator maintains minimal coordination state
- **Strategic Summarization**: Progressive compression of completed iterations
- **Capacity Monitoring**: Proactive context limit detection and planning
